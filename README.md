# Textify
Python module for a text based graphical engine. 

# Rendering
The rendering can be done on an average console, this module does not need helping modules/packages.

# Why should you use this

It may be to decrease processing - power for simulations, style your game as console based game giving it a distinguished look, or give a console based software/tool a beautiful ascii look rather than boring text, or just because it is so easy to use and the many possibilities that can be done with these simple functions that would teach a beginner at programming or teach how programming works for simulations/games.

There are wild possibilities that can be done with this compared to other rendering modules of python. This module has ease of use, compatibility with most computers and is extremely efficient in its processing.
